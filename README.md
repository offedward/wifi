# python-wifi
Hello everyone! This is a python script for "hacking" wifi passwords. How is working? The script itself
is not so complicated , it creates three lists, get the files that we need , and gets the SSID and the 
password from a .xml file. It needs to be updated , because it shows the same network multiple times , 
and I didn't figured it out why yet. How can it be used? First you will need python on the machine 
where you want to run this script. 
Hope you will enjoy it!
